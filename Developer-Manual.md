[Support Mailbox](mailto:journey-service@sbb.ch)

## Abstract
The Journey-Service is a RESTful **"Journey-Planner"** facade abstracting **public transportation routing and planning** for a set of **SBB Switzrland** relevant underlying systems, such as Hafas, HIM, CUS, INFO+, DiDok, CAPRE, FOS, PLABE, OccupancyPrognosis, NOVA etc.

The main **Use Cases** are:
* Finding **`Place`** (aka OJP `Location`), such as `StopPlace` resp. (stations for public transport trains, busses, tramways, ...), `AddressPlace` and `PoiPlace` (Points of Interest (POI)).
* Finding concrete journeys (`Trip`, `DatedVehicleJourney`) as passenger-information.
* Finding some SBB specific additional info (such as `Trainformation`s, Realtime monitoring etc)

A set of implemented **SBB Business Rules** (such as delays, platform changes,...) guarantees that consuming channels may display consistent data.

If you are new to journey-planning with SBB, consider general standards as mentioned in [chapter "Routing Standards in "Public Transport"](v3/Journey-Service_v3_MODEL.md)

### Design Goals
* Strategic usage for SBB and partners: **Journey-Planner** systems are a business critical core functionality at SBB. Plenty of Consumer applications use it (like [sbb.ch](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html), [SBB Mobile](https://www.sbb.ch/de/fahrplan/mobile-fahrplaene/sbb-mobile.html), [SBB Ticket vending machines](https://www.sbb.ch/de/bahnhof-services/am-bahnhof/services-am-billettautomat/sbb-billettautomat.html), [SBB Group reservation and Capacity management](https://company.sbb.ch/de/sbb-als-geschaeftspartner/dienstleistungen/vertriebsmanagement-ktu/produkte/capre.html), [SBB B2P](https://company.sbb.ch/content/dam/sbb/de/pdf/sbb-konzern/sbb-als-geschaeftspartner/partnervertrieb/webserviceB2P_factsheet_d.pdf) and many others.
* [Business aspects](business/BusinessAspects.md): all consumer get the same information (we work hard to enhance quality and continuous feature innovation).
* Easy usage by consumer developers: Our APIs are **RESTful** and documented, [Openapi 3](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/) **generated ApiClient** capable.
* Follow existing standards but simplify and adapt to enhance time-to-market of new customer-information features

#### Release Notes (SBB internal)
See [SBB staff release notes](https://code.sbb.ch/projects/KI_FAHRPLAN/repos/journey-service/browse/ReleaseNotes.md).
Because J-S heavily relies on the Journey-Assistant library, also those [J-A Release-Notes](https://code.sbb.ch/projects/KI_FAHRPLAN/repos/journey-assistant/browse/ReleaseNotes.md) might reveal some important updates.

## API in detail
All Services (short abstract, request-parameters, response-models) are documented directly by swagger-annotations, therefore the documentation below is reduced to the max and is hopefully rarely necessary for v3 (or v2) API understanding in most cases.
